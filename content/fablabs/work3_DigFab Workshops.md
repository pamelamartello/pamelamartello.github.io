From a 3D model to a prototype. Making digitally fabricated objects.

>Digital fabrication has helped me so much in my design process that I am always happy to share what I learned with other people, hoping they can implement these techniques and use them, being for a personal project or even for a product prototype.

I've organized several workshops mostly in collaboration with [FabLabs](https://www.fablabs.io/), where we focus on teaching 2D and 3D design skills, from concept to fabrication using mainly laser cutting and 3D printing.

## Laser Cutting workshops

Laser cutting is one, or maybe it is the one, of my favorite machines. It is not only fast but versatile, you can do so many things even though you are working in 2D. 

Most of the time the topic of the workshops I teach is focused on Jewelry, but not only.

The normal content I teach for laser cutting workshops is:
* Introduction to 2D Vector Software
* Setting up your files for laser cutting
* Introduction to laser cutting technologies and materials
* Machine operation and set up 
* Laser cutting prototypes

## 3D Printing workshops

![3d printed jewelry](/img/digitally-fab-jewelry/3d-printed-jewelry.jpg)

I've been exploring 3D printing for some years now and for my work it has been an essential tool.
I normally use FDM printers or SLA printers, being FDM the easiest and most accessible to use inside a FabLab. Therefore my classes always focus on learning how to use and set up FDM printers.

The content of the 3D printing workshops I normally teach covers the following:

* Introduction to 3D modeling using OPEN SOURCE software such as FUSION 360 or TinkerCad for beginners 
* Slicing your model using OPEN SOURCE slicer software such as CURA
* Introduction to 3D printing technologies and materials 
* Setting up an FDM printer and print your models

It is normal and common to come up with problems while doing the print or setting up the files, we try to debug and learn together what the issues are, helping not only the students to have a better understanding but also for me as a teacher to learn more.

>I've held several of these workshops mostly in FabLabs, in Shanghai, and I had the chance to give some as well in Seoul.
