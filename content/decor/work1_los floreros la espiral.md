#### About

I love having flowers at home, it is a little joy that can bring so much color to the room and even change the atmosphere. 

These are a series of acrylic handmade vases designed and crafted from my studio in Shanghai.

A unique decorative item for your home, or working space, that I hope will brighten up your day together with your favorite flowers.
Making every pair unrepeatable & uncommon.

##### *The inspiration*  
When I was experimenting on the flower vases series, it really felt like I should let the material guide me.

The most natural, fluid and the very first shape that came out was the spiral.

Moving from a fixed point while constantly receding from it...  
An uninterrupted search towards and from the center, the core...  
&nbsp;

While making this vase I found a poem (or the poem found me) which connected with me at that time and with the concept of this vase.

Here is an excerpt from this poem that titled ***Espiral*** (Spiral) by **Octavio Paz**, Mexican Writer:

*Espiral  
“...Y la espiral en cada cosa  
su vibración difunde en giros:  
el movimiento no reposa.”  

**“...And the spiral in everything  
spreads its vibration in turns  
the movement does not rest.”**  


***by O.Paz***

I made four different colors, each of them hand dyed.

#### How to use

To enjoy them simply add water inside the tubes and place your favourite flowers.  
Or even without any water, just by putting dry flowers in them.

#### Size & color

Every vase is handmade, therefore the sizes may vary slightly every time I make a new one.  
The average size of each vase is close to the proportions shown below. 

As for the colors, the gradients may be slightly lighter or darker as I do the dying by hand.
