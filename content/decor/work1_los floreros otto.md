#### About

I love having flowers at home, it is a little joy that can bring so much color to the room and even change the atmosphere. 

These are a series of acrylic handmade vases designed and crafted from my studio in Shanghai.

A unique decorative item for your home, or working space, that I hope will brighten up your day together with your favorite flowers.
Making every pair unrepeatable & uncommon.

##### *The inspiration*

***Otto***, from Italian ***eight***.

Our homes are our small sanctuaries, places to relax, to learn, to share joy, to nourish...

I designed ***Otto*** with the intention to be part of your special cocoon.  
To share with you this special space of yours.

I felt inspired by the continuity and the flow of the infinite shape âˆž.

A symbol connected to the infinite, limitless...

Asides from its symbolism, I dedicated this vase to a very special and dear little human named Otto.  
As a way to bring me closer to him regardless of the distance.)

Designed as a stage for flowers, to embrace them gracefully and delicately.

An item to adorn your favourite place at home.  
Adding a little spark of color and vibrance into the room.

Every vase I make I also hand dye it.  
I have four different colors available on my online shop.

#### How to use

To enjoy them simply add water inside the tubes and place your favourite flowers.  
Or even without any water, just by putting dry flowers in them.

#### Size & color

Every vase is handmade, therefore the sizes may vary slightly every time I make a new one.  
The average size of each vase is close to the proportions shown below. 

As for the colors, the gradients may be slightly lighter or darker as I do the dying by hand.
