>*florero (from Spanish) a container used to place flowers* 

##### *The collection*

One day someone dear to me gave me some very small, colorful, and delicate flowers. I was looking for a container that would hold them gracefully, a stage...

Wondering what I could use, I jumped into my studio and I started experimenting with some of my tools and materials....

And this is how this series started...

#### About
##### *handmade flower vases*

*Los Floreros* is a collection of acrylic vases that I design and make with the intention to bring a little spark of color and vibrance into your home.

I make each of the vases by hand,both the shape and coloring is done from my studio.  
Making each of them irrepetible.

The family has three styles:  
***La Espiral***  
***Otto***   
***La Ola***

You can explore each of the vases inside the section [decor](https://www.pamelamartello.github.io/portfolio/) of my portfolio.

#### How to use

You can add some water inside the tubes and place your small flowers in both or only one of the two holes.

Or if you like desiccated flowers you can place them inside without the water.

#### Size & color

Every vase is handmade, therefore the sizes may vary slightly every time I make a new one.  
The average size of each vase is close to the proportions shown below. 

As for the colors, the gradients may be slightly lighter or darker as I do the dying by hand.
