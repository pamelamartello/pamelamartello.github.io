>*traditions inspired by my hometown Mexico*  

&nbsp;  
February 1st of 2022 marked the change to the year of the Tiger in the Chinese Lunar Calendar.  
For this reason I decided to celebrate it blending my traditions and the local ones, by making these series of masks, that symbolozi a token of good luck and prosperity for the year ahead.  
&nbsp;   
The year of the hǔ 虎.
&nbsp;  
#### Rooted in Folklore  
&nbsp;  
The **Tecuanes** are a series of handmade masks rooted in a traditional Folkloric Dance from my hometown.  

These masks are a personal work inspired by the traditions and the talent of the artesanos from my homeland.
They are my own version of the original Tecuan masks worn for the dance of the tecuanes that we celebrate.

Each mask is entirely handmade, from the structure to the tiniest detail, and it takes me about 2 weeks to make one.

This is my way of bringing a small piece of Mexico all the way here and sharing it with you.  
Hoping that it will keep you company and will bring you good luck throughout this year of the tiger.
