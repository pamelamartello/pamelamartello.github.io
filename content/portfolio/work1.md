3D modelling is not magic, but can look like magic...

For 3D modelling I use Rhinoceros 3D as my main software but, I use as well Fusion 360 depending on the nature of the project, being the first software more suitable for Jewelry Design (as my personal poin of view). 
After making the 3D model I work on the rendering part (adding materials and light), I combine different softwares for this stage.

Here are some examples of the 3D modelling works I've done. Some of the projects remained as a visual proposal for clients and others made in collections.

### Animalitos collection
