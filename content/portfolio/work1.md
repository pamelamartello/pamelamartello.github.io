3D modeling is not magic but can look like magic...

For 3D modeling I mainly use Rhinoceros 3D software but, I try to use and explore other softwares like Fusion 360. 
Depending on the nature of the project, being for me Rhinos the more suitable for Jewelry Design, I use different mediums.

Commonly after making the 3D model of my designs, I work on the rendering part (adding materials and light). For this stage, I combine as well as several different software.

Here are some examples of the 3D modeling works I've done. Some of the projects remained as a visual proposal for clients and others were made into a physical product.

### Animalitos collection
