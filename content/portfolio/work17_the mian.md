>*The collection noodle “面”, is a series of unique acrylic hand-bent sculptural earrings.*

##### *Their silhouette is a personal interpretation of one of my favorite dishes in Chinese cuisine: noodles.*

I’ve always been fascinated by the transformation of materials through heating, and cooking is all about that.
This organic reshaping is what inspired me.

And to these organic shapes I added a hand-dyed gradient of colors, such colors are one of the key elements I always love to play with.

#### Materials used
##### *one of a kind*

The earrings gracefully hang on a pair of 18k white gold plated 925 Silver clips.

The central piece, the noodle, is hand bent and hand-dyed. 

Each of them made one by one.
Making every pair unrepeatable & uncommon.
