#### *Reshaping materials*

Every time I am at my workshop table I love to lose myself molding materials and transforming their shapes.

The feeling of using my hands and tools to create brand new objects is what fulfills me the most. 

I really hope that these small sculptures will become part of our bodies, adding them to our own curves, colors, shapes, and mood. Helping us to create the unique composition we all are.

##### *Inspiration.*

The collection BENT was born from this experimentation of reshaping materials, under the idea of creating organically shaped pieces that are colorful, bulky, and yet light to use.

Each of the rings is made in acrylic and shaped by hand. Making them slightly different to each other and unique, just like you ;)

##### *The models*

I created three main shapes for this series. 

Each one of them comes in different colors and sizes, some colors are transparent, some are matte and some others are solid.

Every one of them is made with lots of care and love. Check below which style resonates with you and get in touch with me if you would like to get one.
