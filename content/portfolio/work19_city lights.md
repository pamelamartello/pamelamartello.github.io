>*Digital Fabrication & Jewelry hands on workshop*  

&nbsp;  
*Many said this was the cyberpunk city  
they've always imagined.  
It must be the lights at night.  
But for those who've been around,  
we no longer feel the excitement.  
We no longer admire the lights  
with eyes of wonder.  
P.C.*

Luckily we can reimagine how to see the lights again...

#### City lights
##### *Workshop about the interaction between shape & lights*  
&nbsp;  
I love to organize and host workshops that combine Digital Fabrication and Jewelry making.  
&nbsp;  
This is part of a series of workshop that I designed to teach at [**AIVA**](https://www.aiva.com.cn/) *(Academy of International Visual Arts in Shanghai)*. It is about experimenting how light and shape interact with each other, using as means: LEDs, paper, plywood, and a simple electronic circuit.

Together we fabricate a brooch (pin) that lights up by a stripe of LEDs which I guide students on how to make and solder it.  
The each participant has total freedom to play with the materials give to create a *diffuser* that covers the light source.
