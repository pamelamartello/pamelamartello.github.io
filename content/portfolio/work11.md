Let's VOGUE by Summer - music videoclip.

This is a project I keep dear in my heart, as it was one of my first works I did when I arrived to Shanghai.

### About the project

I was consigned to design two pieces of jewelry for a music video ["Let's Vogue" by Summer](https://vimeo.com/78047148). The designs had to show the word "VOGUE" and had to reflect the spirit of the music video and the artist.

I designed one bracelet and a necklace.
Both of them were handmade by myself. For the bracelet I used black acrylic and brass. And for the necklace brass.
