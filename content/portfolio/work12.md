**_What is a FabLab?_**
>A [FabLab](https://www.fablabs.io/) is a Digital Fabrication laboratory open to the public and their mission is to support and encourage the makers and open source culture.
A normal fully equiped FabLab has the basic tooling that includes: **Laser cutting machine, 3D printers, power tools, hand tools, CNC milling machines, and electronics working bench**. Every FabLab runs differently but normally regular activites are organized so that the community learns how to use these equipment and then be able to use them on their own.

### Working in a FabLab?

While working as a jewelry designer in 2017 I got involved helping as a volunteer in a non-profit FabLab [XINFAB](https://www.xinfab.com/about.html) where I had the chance to experiment and learn more about digital fabrication as I wanted to integrate this world into my jeweler formation.

I volunteered at XinFab for a year helping organizing workshops, maintaining the space and helping to run the lab. After that in 2018 I was hired as a Space Manager to help running the space.
Some of my main tasks while working here were:

* Management of the space
* Writing content for their social media channels (WECHAT, MEETUP, and  website)
* Website maintenance
* Graphic Design for social media content
* 3D printing and laser cutting service 
* Community management 
* Machinery maintenance and operation 
* Organizing and hosting workshops about 3DPrinting, laser cutting and 2D/3D software
* Organizing and hosting meetups to connect and collaborate with the community

If you are curious you can check out [XINFAB](https://www.xinfab.com/index.html) website or our [MEETUP](https://www.meetup.com/Xinfab-Fablab/events/past/) site to see what we were doing with the makers community. Here are some of the ones I helped organizing and hosting:
