Inspired by a dear childhood friend who has always been fascinated about how birds were depicted throughout history I decided to make a series of **_pajaritos_** (little birds) inspired in my hometown Mexico.

Sketches of my own interpretation of birds.

#### Rendering & making process

The earrings were designed in 3D software Rhinoceros, after that, I printed the models in castable wax and proceed to cast them in silver 925.
Following up by the cleaning process of filing, welding, and polishing, entirely made by hand.
