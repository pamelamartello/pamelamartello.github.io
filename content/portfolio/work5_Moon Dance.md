Custom made jewelry
<!--more-->

One of the reasons why I love jewelry and making jewelry is that it is personal and it is attached to a story or special moment.
I am lucky to have done several custom made projects for special moments to someone out there.
I've decided to show on my site those works I feel especially connected to. 

For the following project, I was consigned to design a pair of earrings for her special birthday celebration.

> The central theme of this project is the sun and the moon. Some of the keywords given to me were: minimalist, zen, organic, original, design, mixed media. I tried to capture the essence of this strong meanings and represent them in these pair of earrings designed for a special person. 

The following is an inspirational mood board, the original works are from [Pierre Voisin](https://theultralinx.com/2015/08/perfectly-simple-geometric-illustrations-by-pierre-voisin/):

#### Shape study

As part of my working process, I do a preliminary study of the shape and a 3D model to understand the design of the earrings

#### Production

Several prototypes were made using 3D printing and laser cutting to improve the shape, size, and wearability. After the final model was confirmed then I printed the pieces in castable wax, which then goes through a process called “lost wax” in order to obtain the pieces in silver (925). After these steps, follows a process of cleaning, file, welding and the final step, the polishing (all hand made).

#### Wearing variations

This style of earrings is called  **_jacket earrings_**, which means one part goes behind your earlobe and one in front of it. The design includes 8 components: 4 stud earrings (silver and gold plated), 2 interchangeable jackets plugs (gold plated) and the two main structures (silver 925).

The variations allow the user to exchange the parts and combine them. You can play and create different combinations when you wear them. Here are some variation examples.
