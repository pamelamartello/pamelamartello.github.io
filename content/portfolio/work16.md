#### Advice # 1 
##### *Know your jewelry, what is it made of?*

This collections is made out of silver 925 and brass with 18k yellow gold plating. You need to know that metals react to the environment and can change with the time and care that you put.

Silver and brass are metals that can get tarnished with the time, it is normal. Gold plating is a "bath" that with the time will run off. So try to avoid using any kind of chemicals to clean your jewelry. All you need to clean them is some soft cloth.

#### Advice # 2
##### *no matter what sports you practice better take them off!*

Your jewelry will prefer if you avoid doing muay thai/yoga/cycling/ballet, etc, with them, they are not keen of our sweat. Especially during shower time, don’t take them with you. And if you wear perfume remember to put them on after your beauty ritual. 

So, remember to take them off before!

#### Advice # 4
##### *about gold plating*

Some elements of your jewelry have been gold plated. This means they have a thin layer of 18k yellow gold, on top of the brass. Within the years, usage and care, this thin layer might run off, if this ever happens to you, don’t panic the gold plating can be re-done again.
