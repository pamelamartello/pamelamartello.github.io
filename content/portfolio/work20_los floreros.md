##### *The collection*

One day someone dear to me gave me some very small, colorful, and delicate flowers. I was looking for a container that would hold them gracefully, a stage...

#### About
##### *handmade flower vases*

I love having flowers at home, it is a little joy that can bring so much color to the room and even change the atmosphere. 

These are a series of acrylic handmade vases designed and crafted from my studio in Shanghai.

A unique decorative item for your home, or working space, that I hope will brighten up your day together with your favorite flowers.
Making every pair unrepeatable & uncommon.
