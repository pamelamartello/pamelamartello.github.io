## FabAcademy Final Project

In 2019 I joined an amazing adventure in the world of Digital Fabrication the [FabAcademy](https://fabacademy.org/) course. It is an intensive 20 weeks course where you learn **HOW TO MAKE ALMOST ANYTHING**. 

During this course you have to come up with a final project that integrates as many tools and topics learnt throughout the FabAcademy. 

### Smart cat-door entrance system

For my final project, I decided to make something for our Shanghainese cat *Mirru*.
The idea is for her to access our home with a special key *(a special necklace with a tag)* that enables the opening only to her and no other cat/animal can enter her/our house.
The entrance is not only a door but a shelter for her where she can rest, chill or protect from the weather.
For this project I made most of the parts and systems by myself, using from 3D printing, laser cutting, CNC milling, PCB design, programming, molding and casting, research and lots of patience.

>The project is **OPEN SOURCE** and you can find the full documentation about my work [HERE](http://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/oshanghai/students/pamela-arana/index.html). These are all the systems and parts I designed and fabricated:

#### Project components
