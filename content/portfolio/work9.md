## FabAcademy Final Project

In 2019 I joined an amazing adventure in the world of Digital Fabrication the [FabAcademy](https://fabacademy.org/) course. It is an intense 20 weeks course where you learn **HOW TO MAKE ALMOST ANYTHING**. 

During this course you have to come up with a final project that integrates as many tools and topics learnt throughout the FabAcademy. 


>For my final project I decided to make something for our Shanghainese cat *Mirru*.
The idea is for her to access our home with a special key *(a special necklace with a tag)* that enables the opening only to her and no other cat/animal can enter her/our house.
The entrance is not only a door but a shelter for her where she can rest, chill or protect from the weather.

Meet Mirrunis she lives indoors but every morning we open the window so that she can go out to explore and run around with her other parkour cat-friends.
