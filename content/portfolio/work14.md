Last year during my experience at the FabAcademy as you are not allowed to use any commercial board during the course (like an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)), I had the chance to learn how to make my own PCB (Printed Circuit Board) and learn how to program them, which for me was the hardest task of all.

I wanted to add this part of my work on my portfolio, not only to show the process of how I made them and what I used them for, but also because I find that the PCBs in general, are aesthetically so beautiful that they itself could be a jewel! 

This is the list of materials and softwares I used along the process:
* [Eagle](https://www.autodesk.ca/en/products/eagle/free-download) Open-source software from Autodesk, used to create the schematics of the board.
* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/) to program my boards to "make something".
* [FR1 phenolic paper](https://www.alibaba.com/showroom/fr1-phenolic-paper-laminated-sheet.html) the material used to make the PCB.
* [CNC milling machine](https://code.visualstudio.com/) milling machine to "carve" the traces.

During one of my assignments I choose to make an Arduino-compatible board based on an ATMEGA328P microcontroller designed by [Daniele Ingrassia](http://www.fabacademy.org/archives/2015/eu/students/ingrassia.daniele/index.html)

One of the reasons why our instructor engouraged us to make our own Arduino compatible board was mainly because we would be using Arduino IDE to program it, and this would make it less difficult when doing the programming and there's lots of documentation about this type of boards. Also, it was a harder challenge and they liked to keep us suffering during the course.
