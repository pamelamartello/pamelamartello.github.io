Special jewelry for Special people
<!--more-->

One of the reasons why I love jewelry and making jewelry, is that it is personal and it is attached to a story or special moment.
I am lucky to have done several custom made projects for special moments to someone out there.
I've decided to show on my site those works I feel specially connected to. 

For the following project I was consigned to design a pair of earrings for a person and her special birthday celebration.

> The inspiration behind was the interpretation of the sun and the moon as a central theme. Some of the keywords given to me were: minimalist, zen, organic, original, design, mix media. I tried to capture the essence of this strong meanings and represent them in these pair of earrings designed for a special person. 

The following is an inspirational moodboard, the original works are from [Pierre Voisin](https://theultralinx.com/2015/08/perfectly-simple-geometric-illustrations-by-pierre-voisin/):

#### Shape study

A preliminary study of the shape is done and a 3D model is built in order to understand the design of the earrings.

#### Production

Several prototypes were made using 3D printing and laser cutting in order to improve the shape, size, and wearability. After the final model was confirmed then I printed the pieces in castable wax, which then goes through a process called “lost wax” in order to obtain the pieces of silver (925). After this steps, they go through a long process of cleaning, file, welding and the final step, the polishing.

#### Wearing variations

This style of earrings is called  “jacket earrings”, which means one part goes behind your earlobe and one in front of it. The design includes 8 components: 4 stud earrings (silver and gold plated), 2 interchangeable jackets plugs (gold plated) and the two main structures (silver).

This variations allows the user to exchange the parts and combine them. You can play and create different combinations when you wear them. Here are some variation examples.
