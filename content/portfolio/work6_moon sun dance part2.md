#### About the collection

I felt like exploring a bit more the previous ***moon & sun dance*** customized earrings that I designed for my friend.  
So I took it further and developed a complete collection of earrings that is now available in my online shop.

>*Earrings inspired by the shapes and colors of different stars and satellites*

I wanted to create a series of earrings that allowed the user to combine different shapes and different colors.  
So, for this, I decided to use silver and brass as the main materials.

A series of interchangeable earrings that are made of two parts: *the front* and *the back*, also called **jacket-style** earrings.  
I designed each part with different materials as I wanted to create a contrast of color and shadows.  
Every pair has two components, each made of silver and/or brass (with 18k gold plating).

#### How to use

You can wear them as single studs, or front and back, or both pieces on the front of your ear lobe as I illustrate below:

#### The styles and combinations

The styles I designed are available as sets (2 pieces) or as single studs.  
The idea is that you can mix and match all of them even wear different models on each ear lobe.
