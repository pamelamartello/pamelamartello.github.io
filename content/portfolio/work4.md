#### Development of educational programs 

<!--more-->

Since 2019 I started an on-going collaboration with **[FabLabO Shanghai](https://fablabo.com/)** in **Tongji University**, developing STEAM educational programs for students from Primary School to High School through Digital Fabrication technologies.

The curricular activities we develop are for beginners to advanced levels. Each course and level focuses on one or more digital fabrication skills being: laser cutting, 3D printing, 3D modeling, electronics, programming.
FabLaO programs aim to promote critical thinking, problem-solve, discovery and creation through a fun and engaging way.

#### Paper Circuits (Grade 1-2)

Paper circuits is a very versatile way to teach students the basics of what is and how to make a low-voltage electronic circuit, great for beginners and younger students. 
During this course, students learn how to make their own low-voltage electronic circuit on paper, designing and building their own city.

Asides from developing the content of the lessons we also work on the kits that contain materials and instructions to distribute to students during the lessons.

#### The BioBook (Grade 1-2)

![bioplastics](/img/fablabo/bio-plastics-1.jpg)

This course is a work in progress we've been trying to develop as a series of experimental workshops where we make our own materials plant and animal-based. 
The workshop *BioBook* is inspired majorly by the great work and research that **[MATERIOM](https://materiom.org/)** has been hardly working on. 

The idea of this course is that students learn how we can make their own sheets of BioPlastics made from agar or gelatine, letting students experiment and try different "recipes". With the materials they will create, students will make a book that goes beyond text and imagery, which opens up new narratives through materials, texture, and color.

>*As future Makers we aim to encourage students to find alternatives to materials that make part of a circular economy.*

#### Fantastic Explorers (Grade 3-5)

In this course students design and create a set of **_exploration tools_** that they will use to explore their city. Aiming to promote students to appreciate and care about their surroundings, through a fun process of observation, learning, and making.

Each tool combines one or more fabrication skills, like below the explorer goggles module combines 3D printing, electronics, and laser cutting.

Another module from the same course *Fantastic Explorers* is the making of an **_Inflatable Wristband_**. This module focus on the making of soft robotics aided by 2D vectorial software and vinyl cutting.
Students have to design and make a special inflatable bracelet that is made using sealing materials and air to inflate it using baking paper to create an air chamber inside.
