### Educational programs development 

<!--more-->

Since 2019 I started an on-going collaboration with **[FabLabO Shanghai](https://fablabo.com/)** in **Tongji University**, developing STEAM educational programs for students from Primary School to High School through Digital Fabrication technologies.

The curricular activities we develop are for beginners to advanced levels. Each course and level focuses on one or more digital fabrication skills: laser cutting, 3D printing, 3D modelling, electronics, programming.
FabLaO programs aim to promote critical thinking, problem-solve, discovery and creation through a fun an engaging way.

### Paper Circuits (Grade 1-2)

Paper circuits is a very versatile way to teach students the basics of what is and how to make a low-voltage electronic circuit, great for beginners and younger students. During this course students learn how to make their own low-voltage electronic circuit created on paper designing and building their own three-dimensional city tinkering with circuits.

Asides from developing the content of the lessons we also work on the kits that contain materials and instructions to distibute to students during the lessons.

### The BioBook (Grade 1-2)

![bioplastics](/img/fablabo/bio-plastics-1.jpg)

This course is a work in progress we've been trying to develop a series of experimental workshops were we make our own materials plant and animal based. 
The workshop *BioBook* is inspired majorly by the great work and reserach that **[MATERIOM](https://materiom.org/)** has been hardly working on. 

The idea of this course we've been working on developing is that students learn how we can make our own sheets of BioPlastics made from agar or gelatine, letting students to experiment and try different "recipes" . With the materials students will make we will create a book that goes beyond text and imagery, that opens up new narratives through materials, texture and color.

>*As future Makers we aim to encourage students to find alternatives to materials that make part of a circular economy.*

### Fantastic Explorers (Grade 3-5)

In this course students design and create a set of *exploration tools* that they will use to explore their city. Aiming to promote students to appreciate and care their surroundings, through a fun process of observation, learning and making.

Each tool combines one or more fabrication skills, like below the explorer goggles module combines 3D printing, electronics and laser cutting.

Another module from the same course *Fantastic Explorers* is the making of an **Inflatable Wristband**. This module focus on the making of soft robotics aided by 2D vectorial software and vinyl cutting.
Students have to design and make a special inflatable bracelet that is made using sealing materials and air to inflate it using baking paper to create an air chamber inside.
