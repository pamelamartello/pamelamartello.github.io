What if jewelry exists briefly? changing shape, texture, and state, allowing the user to see and feel the transformation.

Imagine we could wear jewelry that during the day will transform the state, bringing visual and sensory experiences to the user. 

This is an experimental project where I wanted to use water and play with the idea of altering the shape of the object by a temperature difference.

I placed small rocks inside the ring, they are kept inside like something precious and delicate, but they are revealed and exposed when water melts.

### Making process

Sketching the shape of the ring.

Making of the 3D model. I first made the ring and then the mold based on its shape.

Milling the mold using a castable wax.

Cleaned and smooth some areas of the mold.

Making of the silicone mold.

After doing the first casting I realized the channel I did to inject the material was too small so I increased it, and also added an extra channel for air circulation.
