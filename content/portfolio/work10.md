From a 3D model to a prototype. Making digitally fabricated objects for the everyday life.

>Digital fabrication has helped me so much in my design process that I am always happy to share what I learned with other people, hoping they can implement these techniques and use them, being for a personal project or even for a product prototype.
Most of the workshops I've organized have been in collaboration with a [FabLab](https://www.fablabs.io/), were we focus on teaching 2D and 3D Design skills, from concept to fabrication using laser cutting and 3D printing.

## Laser Cutting workshops

Laser cutting is one, or maybe is the one, of my favourite machines. Is not only fast but versatile, you can do so many things even though you are working in 2D. 

Most of the time I focus the workshop topics in Jewelry making but not only.

The normal content I teach for laser cutting workshops is:
* 2D design using Vector Software *(introduction to the software and main tools)*
* Setting up your files for laser cutting
* Laser cutting technologies and materials introduction
* Machine operation and set up 
* Laser cutting prototypes

## 3D Printing workshops

I've been exploring 3D printing for some years now and for my work it has been an essential tool.
I normally use FDM printers or SLA printers, being FDM the easiest and most accessible to use. Therefore my classes always focus on learning how to operate FMD printers and how to set up your 3D models for this type of machine.

The content of the 3D printing workshops I teach normally covers the following:

* 3D modelling using OPEN SOURCE software such as FUSION 360 or TinkerCad for beginners *(introduction to the software and main tools)*
* Slicing your model using OPEN SOURCE slicer software such as CURA
* 3D printing technologies and materials introduction
* Setting up an FDM printer and print your models

It is normal and common to come up with problems while doing the print or setting up the files, we try to debug and learn together what the issues are, helping not only the students to have a better understand but also for me as a teacher to learn more.

>I've held several of these workshops mostly in FabLabs, in Shanghai, and I had the chance to give some as well in Seoul.
