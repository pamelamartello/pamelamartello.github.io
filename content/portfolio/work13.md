**_Documentation_**

While doing the FabAcademy I realized how useful it is to keep track of what you do and about sharing publicly (open-source). 
I would like to share how I built my website and contribute to the community as it has done with me.

List of software, platforms and language used:
* [HUGO](https://gohugo.io//) It is a static site generator and I used one of their themes as a template
* [GITHUB](https://github.com//) I used it to host my website
* [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) markup language (very simple)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) source-code editor (open-source)
