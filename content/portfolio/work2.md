> #### can the user be part of the making process?

The Punch-Out Jewelry Kit is a design where the user becomes an important part of the creative process.
Assemble your own jewelry. Combine and match, be the owner of your style!

#### idea
As a child (I hope you were), you probably owned or saw “punch-out” or “cut-out” assembly toys. The concept is simple: an object in separate pieces arranged on a frame that you punch out piece by piece and assemble into a toy— this is the main inspiration for this jewelry collection. 

By allowing the user to assemble the parts of their jewelry as they wish, they can experience the joy that creating something yourself brings.

#### how is it made?

This collection is made using acrylic, silver and brass. The techniques and materials used were: laser cutting for the main structure of the punch out kit, and brass for the handmade inserts.

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn't listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way.

When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then
