Together with [**Jiro Hsu**](https://www.instagram.com/asjirogoes/) we designed the packaging of my jewwelry line.  
I wrote down an article where we talk about the inspiration, the process and also about Jiro's cosmos of creation.  
Read more about it!

#### Rooted in Mexican Folk Art
&nbsp;  
A special packaging, meant not only for carrying and storing your jewels, but we hope they can become another decor item in your room.
Bringing you a little spark of color.
