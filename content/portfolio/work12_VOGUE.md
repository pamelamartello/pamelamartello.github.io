### *Let's VOGUE* by Summer - music video clip

This is a project I keep dear in my heart, as it was one of the first works I did when I arrived in Shanghai.

### About the project

I was assigned to design a necklace and a bracelet for a music video ["Let's Vogue" by Summer](https://vimeo.com/78047148). The designs had to show the word "VOGUE" and had to reflect the spirit of the music video and the artist.

For the bracelet, I combined black acrylic and brass. And for the necklace brass. I made both of the designs entirely by hand.
