Hello! My name is Pamela I am from Mexico and I have been based in Shanghai for over 8 years.

My formation is in Jewelry Design, and thanks to several opportunities I’ve had along with my career I have been able to work in different fields, learning different skills and workflows in the field of Design.

Currently, I work as a freelance Designer and about one year ago I started my own brand of jewelry and decorative objects here in Shanghai.

Before this, I have mainly worked as a designer developing and following the production of Jewelry design collections. I also got involved in the Digital Fabrication world of FabLabs, starting first as a volunteer and then working as a FabLab Manager.

And this portfolio is a short summary of some of the main projects I have been involved in since my arrival to 上海.
I have worked in China for different jewelry brands and in the past years, I got involved in the makers' world. Focusing and developing my work towards Digital Fabrication in Jewelry Making and in the development of educational programs that involve these technologies.
