<p>I really hope you will enjoy these jewelry, that you will feel connected to it and that it will bring a sparkle of joy to you when you wear them.</p>

<h4 id="advice--1">Advice # 1</h4>
<h5 id="know-your-jewelry-what-is-it-made-of"><em>Know your jewelry, what is it made of?</em></h5>
<p>This collections is made out of silver 925 and brass with 18k yellow gold plating. You need to know that metals react to the environment and can change with the time and care that you put.</p>
<p>Silver and brass are metals that can get tarnished with the time, it is normal. Gold plated jewellery will wear off over time, however you can make it last longer taking extra care when wearing, storing and cleaning it. 
Try to avoid using any kind of chemicals to clean your jewelry. All you need to clean them is some soft cloth.</p>

<p>Your jewelry will prefer if you avoid doing muay thai/yoga/cycling/ballet, etc, with them, they are not keen of our sweat. Especially during shower time, donâ€™t take them with you. And if you wear perfume remember to put them on after your beauty ritual.</p>
<p>So, remember to take them off before!</p>

<h4 id="advice--3">Advice # 3</h4>
<h5 id="swimming-is-lovely-but-your-jewelry-will-prefer-not-to"><em>swimming is lovely but your jewelry will prefer not to!</em></h5>
<p>When it comes to swimming your jewelry will feel safer staying indoors. Try to avoid swimming with them.</p>
<p><img src="/img/moon_dance_care/care_3.png" alt="care instructions"></p>
<h4 id="advice--4">Advice # 4</h4>
<h5 id="about-gold-plating"><em>about gold plating</em></h5>
<p>Some elements of your jewelry have been gold plated. This means they have a thin layer of 18k yellow gold, on top of the brass. Gold plated jewellery will wear off over time, but taking good care of them will slow down the process. And remember gold plating can be re-done again, so you can get back that shine at any time!</p>

<h4 id="advice--5">Advice # 5</h4>
<h5 id="cleaning-your-jewelry"><em>cleaning your jewelry</em></h5>
<p>After each wear, it is recommended to clean your jewelry with a soft cloth to remove any natural skin oils.</p>
<p>When cleaning, very gently wipe your gold plated jewellery with a soft polishing cloth. Do not scrub or rub as this can prematurely wear away the layer of gold.</p>
<p>Silver jewellery can be cleaned in warm soapy water.  Please ensure that it is rinsed thoroughly and dried before storing to avoid it tarnishing. Alternatively you can polish your silver jewellery with a soft polishing cloth.</p>
